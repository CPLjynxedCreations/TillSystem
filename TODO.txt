TO DO

for each loop to disable all the sale screen items at the start

int for items to add amounts
	price
	item amount
	total price

Create a couple more items
finish number pad for click value

**FUTURE**
Create blank buttons for item creation
if toggle button active clear the selected item
	move other items up the grid
			if btn.content empty move up
		Maybe each line needs its on string value saved
			to be cleared and replaced by the others
