TO DO

for each loop to disable all the sale screen items at the start

int for items to add amounts
	price
	item amount
	total price
total price to add
amount and item price to change on amount entered
if button 1 pressed already and then 2 pressed total amount needs to = 12
	then item pressed and adds 12


Create a couple more items
finish number pad for click value

**FUTURE**
Create blank buttons for item creation
if toggle button active clear the selected item
	move other items up the grid
			if btn.content empty move up
		Maybe each line needs its on string value saved
			to be cleared and replaced by the others
			data to be saved in excel file
