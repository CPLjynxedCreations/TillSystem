TO DO

create list int for toggle buttons content
	for loop to check content / empty 
	add to existing / create new from loop

Create a couple more items

when nothing has been pressed after a number allow another number to be pressed and create a larger number
	9+6 = 96

after line clear due to empty line
create string list for sale item list
	check list to see if item added
	if item added go through until found
	if not added add to empty space for now.
		it will all adjust to fill the blanks after remove in future
	when an item is removed .remove

**FUTURE**
Create blank buttons for item creation
if toggle button active clear the selected item
	move other items up the grid
			if btn.content empty move up
		Maybe each line needs its on string value saved
			to be cleared and replaced by the others



//CHECK TO SEE IF NUMBER IS A WHOLE NUMBER
private float testNum = 20.3f;


Debug.WriteLine((testNum % 1) == 0);
            Debug.WriteLine(testNum);
